https://adam10603.github.io/GTA5VehicleFlagTool/ here is a resource to view current flags and their combinations, will also decode hex values to show which flags are/were active. (Example in the handling.meta folder search for the strModelFlag and take the numbers that follow after and input them into the search bar to find out what flags are active for the strModelFlag selection.)

https://gtacars.net/ here is a resource that will allow you to view detailed information on every GTAV/GTAO vehicle. Good resource to pinpoint why a vehicle may handle like shit.
